# Predicting_NFL_Plays
The *objective* of this project is to determine if I can **predict the type of play** an offense of an NFL football team will run.

## Executive Summary
The goal for this project is to use 2 classification models - KNeighbors and Logistic Regression - to predict the type of play ran by the offense of an NFL football team. The data for this project was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016). Kaggle has an NFL Play-by-Play dataset from 2009 - 2016 with over 200 features that can be used for many different types of predictions and inference.
The metrics used after modeling were:
- accuracy
- recall (sensitivity)
- specificity
- precision
- confusion matrix (this helped in formulating a couple of the metrics)
All of which are explain the [code](https://github.com/JMWJ/Predicting_NFL_Plays/tree/master/code) link.
